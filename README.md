# CryptoWhales

 ## Creating a deno module

 Started by creating a modul which shows the current prize of each currency listed on Coinbase.

 ## Telegram Bot

 Then we wanted to develop a Telegram Bot to display the current cryptoprice to the user.

 Using the Deno module: https://deno.land/x/telegram_chatbot@v1.0.0 with our module to handle the userinput.

 The name of our Telegram Bot is: @WWI20DSAGetCryptoPricesBot
 
 ### Usage
 
 Start the Bot by typing in /start. Then you can type in the cryptocurrency in the following form:
 
 > cryptocurrency-fiatcurrency // e.g. BTC-USD
 
 The output is the current spot price of the cryptocurrency.
