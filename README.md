# CryptoWhales

## Get Started:

### Install Deno:
```
brew install deno
```

Started by creating a modul which shows the current prize of each currency listed on Coinbase.

Then we wanted to develop a Telegram Bot to display the current cryptoprice to the user.

Using the Deno module: https://deno.land/x/telegram_chatbot@v1.0.0 with our module to handle the userinput.
